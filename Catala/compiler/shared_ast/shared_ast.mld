{0 Default calculus}

This module contains a generic AST structure, various type definitions and
helpers that are reused in various passes of the compiler.

{1 The [Shared_ast.Definitions] module}

The main module {!module: Shared_ast} is exposed at top-level of
the library (so that [open Shared_ast] gives access to the structures). It
defines literals, operators, and in particular the type {!type:Shared_ast.naked_gexpr}.

The {!type:Shared_ast.naked_gexpr} type regroups all the cases for the {{:
../dcalc.html} Dcalc} and {{: ../lcalc.html} Lcalc} ASTs, with unconstrained
annotations (used for positions, types, etc.). A GADT is used to eliminate
irrelevant cases, so that e.g. [(dcalc, _) naked_gexpr] doesn't have the [ERaise] and
[ECatch] cases, while [(lcalc, _) naked_gexpr] doesn't have [EDefault].

For example, Lcalc expressions are then defined as
[type 'm naked_expr = (Shared_ast.lcalc, 'm) Shared_ast.naked_gexpr].

This makes it possible to write a single function that works on the different
ASTs, by having it take a [('a, _) naked_gexpr] as input, while retaining a much
stricter policy than polymorphic variants.

The module additionally defines the encompassing [scope] and [program]
structures that are also shared between different compiler passes.

{1 Helper library}

The {!module: Shared_ast.Var} defines ['e Var.Set.t] and [('e, _) Var.Map.t]
types that are useful to handle variables for the different ['e] expression
types without re-instanciating [Set.Make] and [Map.Make] each time.

{!module: Shared_ast.Expr} contains various helpers to build well-formed
expressions, and for traversal.

The following modules are dedicated to handling the program structure around
expressions. Note that these don't make sense for the early compiler passes (up
to [Scopelang]).
